THIS PLUG-IN REPOSITORY IS NOW OBSOLETE.
CYCLES FOR RHINO PLUG-IN IS NOW BUNDLED WITH RHINO WIP.


Cycles for Rhino
================

Cycles for Rhino plug-in is the integration plug-in to present Cycles
as a render engine to Rhino WIP users. The already existing Raytraced mode
will now be available also as production render possibility.

The plug-in is still WIP, just as Rhino WIP.
